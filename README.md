Skin Cancer AI- This project aims at detecting cancer at earlier stages by distinguishing malignant and benign patches. The building block of this detector are Computer Vision and Deep Learning which are used to process the image of the affected organ, then classify the image using mobilenetV2 which is a Convolutional neural network-based architecture, The hardware implementation is done using Raspberry Pi Model 3B+, Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick, Camera module, etc. The image will be received by the camera, and processing will be done by the Raspberry Pi Model 3B+, the Intel® Movidius™ Neural Compute Stick will do the heavy lifting and the output confidence level will be displayed on the monitor. The goal is to build a machine learning algorithm and pair it with mentioned hardware so that the portable device can identify skin cancer from the image provided even in remote areas where early detection is yet not possible due to lack of healthcare infrastructure
